# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Machine Learning project

Project Description:
I designed and implemented a Credit Card Fraud Detection System to enhance the security of financial transactions and protect cardholders from fraudulent activities. The primary objective of this project was to develop an automated system capable of identifying and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions.

Roles and Responsibilities:
Acquired and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, which included both genuine and fraudulent transactions.
Employed a supervised learning approach, where I trained and evaluated various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent.

Tools and Technologies:
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
Libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

Achievements:
Successfully trained a machine learning model with 100% accuracy using Naive Bayes model in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions.
